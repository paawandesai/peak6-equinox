# Status

_Last updated: 2026-10-07 ~18:15 UTC by operator (M2 code deployed; exit verify MISS)._

## Current milestone

**M2 exit verification (2026-10-07 ~18:00 UTC):** **MISS.** All M2 code tickets merged and deployed to prod (revision equinox-00010-h9v); docs/equivalence.md landed; golden/eval machinery + back-test complete. Exit criteria status:
  1. Precision ≥0.95 at `equivalent` on human-confirmed labels — **BLOCKED** (testdata/golden/labels.yaml empty; Q-7 human gate).
     - Subpart: 0 veto false positives on the veto suite — **MET** (TestPairsFromFixtures 0 FP on 37 V- cases; documented in equivalence.md §8).
     - Subpart: 0 back-test mismatches on fixture set — **MET** (1031 instruments, 207544 pairs, 24/24 agreed; equivalence.md §7–§8).
  2. ≥10 true `equivalent` / `complement` across ≥2 categories in a live round — **MISS** (live revision equinox-00010-h9v pinned round 3: 1 equivalent_given_facts, 1 complement, 25 implies, 851 related = 878 kept; both routable-tier pairs are fed-only, not ≥2 categories).
  3. Fed demo pair + near-miss render correctly live — **PARTIAL** (M2 routes deployed and 200: /near-misses shows 851 related pairs, /log and /eval render, pair pages show facts/basis/type/history; Fed demo pair `equivalent_given_facts` and `complement` render with diff/vetoes/facts; human verification of correctness pending).
  4. docs/equivalence.md merged — **MET** (MR !24 merged as ba0a6c66).

Next operator action (Tier 2): human verification of Fed demo rendering (criterion 3 correctness), then human review of live round for Q-7 label candidates (criterion 1 unblocked).

**Previous:** M1 verification HIT WITH CAVEATS (2026-10-06 ~21:55 CT).

| D-051 | Planned-subcommand stubs in `cmd/equinox/planned.go` (Tier 1 from M1-01; listed for visibility). | 2026-10-06 |
| D-052 | Health check on live `run.app` is `GET /health` (`/healthz` reserved by Cloud Run GFE). Tier 2 from M1-02. | 2026-10-06 |
| D-056 | M1-04: Kalshi endpoint facts corrected in architecture.md (book shape, statuses, `min_close_ts` for settled, 429 pacing). Tier 2 shared-file update. | 2026-10-06 |
| D-057 | M1-05: Polymarket endpoint facts corrected in architecture.md (paging, `up-or-down` exclusion, settled by `endDate` desc, book shape); crypto universe narrowed to `bitcoin` + `ethereum` tags. Tier 2 shared-file update. | 2026-10-06 |
| D-058 | M1-08: Polymarket fee schedule verified in domain.md; Kalshi kept approximate (PDF behind bot checkpoint). Tier 2 shared-file update. | 2026-10-06 |
| D-060 | M1-07: crypto normaliser rules; deadline veto refined **stricter** than D-019 (exact deadline for crypto; "within 24 h" read strictly). Tier 2, touches a veto rule; see Q-4. | 2026-10-06 |
| D-061 (7) | M1-07: `.gitleaks.toml` allowlist for matcher fixture venue market keys (`market_id`/`key: KX…` in `testdata/match/crypto_pairs.yaml` only). Tier 2 CI-gate config; rest of D-061 is Tier 1. | 2026-10-06 |
| D-065 | M1-12: prod start-up migrations; Dockerfile fixes; Scheduler `equinox-collect`; on-demand `equinox match` via Cloud Run job; **match-then-pin** rule so `/` stays on a matched round across Scheduler ticks. Tier 2 (prod deploy). | 2026-10-07 |
| D-066 | M2-03: facts loader (`internal/facts`, `config/facts.yaml`); strict YAML validation; `facts.Set` satisfies `match.Facts`. Tier 1. | 2026-10-07 |

## Open questions

| # | From | Question | Options | Recommendation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Q-1 | kickoff | Does the operator host have `gcloud` authenticated with Owner or Editor on `peak6-equinox-510816`? M1-02 and M1-12 need it to run `scripts/gcp-bootstrap.sh` and `make deploy`. | a) yes; b) the human runs those scripts | **Answered 2026-10-06: (a) yes.** Operator host `gcloud` is logged in as paawankdesai@gmail.com with ADC; project `peak6-equinox-510816` describes ACTIVE. IAM confirms `roles/owner` for paawankdesai@gmail.com on the project. |
| Q-2 | kickoff | Human setup steps before M1-01 merges: create the GitLab label `human-approved`, and a daily pipeline schedule on `main` | n/a | **Answered 2026-10-06:** `human-approved` and `M1` labels created. Daily pipeline schedule id **18** on `main` (`0 6 * * *` UTC) for `log-freshness`. |
| Q-3 | kickoff | Human setup steps after M1-02: put the real Anthropic key in the `equinox-anthropic-key` secret, set the Anthropic console spend limit, and set a $50 GCP budget alert | n/a | Before M3 |
| Q-4 | M1-07 | D-060 makes the crypto deadline veto exact (any gap vetoes) and reads "within 24 h" strictly. Both are stricter than D-019 and cannot lower precision, but they refine a veto rule. Also: in the recorded data Kalshi resolves on CF Benchmarks at 5/6 PM ET and Polymarket on Binance at noon ET, so under D-017 **no recorded cross-venue crypto pair is `equivalent`**; they are `related` with source and deadline vetoes. Live round 3 confirmed 0 `equivalent` / 768 `related`. Should the demo accept that, or should M2 add a documented decision on which sources (if any) count as "documented-identical"? | a) confirm D-060 and accept 0 crypto equivalents in M1; b) keep the exact rule but allow a documented source equivalence in M2 (facts.yaml); c) revert to the plain 24 h tolerance for crypto (fails the ticket's veto suite) | **a** for M1 (done); revisit source equivalence in M2 with the settlement back-test as evidence (NFR-07) |
| Q-5 | M1-07 | `equinox match` stores and logs only `equivalent`-tier results and near-miss `related` results (thresholds within 0.1 %); `--store-all` gives the ticket's literal "one entry per non-unrelated result" (about 50k rows and 50k log entries per round on the recorded universe, D-061). Confirm the default, and decide whether `match` runs after every 5-minute ingest or only on demand / on the pinned round. | a) keep the near-miss default, run `match` on demand and on the pinned round; b) `--store-all` by default with a retention job; c) tighten blocking instead | **a** — operating rule until matching is scheduled: `match` then `pin` (D-065) |
| Q-6 | M2-07 | `/eval` renders a stored JSON artifact at `EVAL_SUMMARY_FILE` (default `config/eval_summary.json`; contract in `internal/web/handlers_eval.go` and D-069). `equinox eval` (M2-05) should write that file, e.g. `--out config/eval_summary.json`, and the prod/demo flow should run it after the human confirms labels so the page stops saying "no eval results yet". | a) M2-05 adds `--out` writing this schema; b) the web page reads `labels.yaml` and recomputes (runs the matcher on a public request; rejected in D-069); c) a `decision_log` kind `eval` (store change, not owned by either ticket) | **a**; until then `/eval` shows the empty state |
| Q-7 | M2-05 | **Human ask (Tier 3):** confirm the golden labels. `testdata/golden/candidates.yaml` holds 40 drafted pairs from the local fixture round (rules-suggested type, vetoes, explanation); `testdata/golden/labels.yaml` ships empty with its schema in the header. **Operator drafted `testdata/golden/labels.proposed.yaml` (2026-10-07) with proposed labels for all 40 pairs** — loud DRAFT header; NOT for `equinox eval` exit gate; human reads both contracts' full text, confirms or corrects each proposed_label, and promotes confirmed entries into `labels.yaml` (`a_id`, `b_id`, `label`, `confirmed_by`, `confirmed_on`, optional `note`). `make eval` reports precision and recall per type; the M2 exit needs precision ≥ 0.95 at `equivalent` (NFR-06). **Precision gate remains PENDING human review.** Note the recorded data has 0 rules-`equivalent` cross-venue pairs (Q-4), so the `equivalent` row stays n/a until a pinned live round with such pairs is drafted (`equinox golden draft --round N` against prod via the equinox-match Cloud Run job, or a documented source equivalence). | a) human edits labels.yaml on a branch the operator opens and merges with the `human-approved` label, treating the file as human-owned data; b) human confirms in the MR thread and the operator transcribes | **a**: the labels are the evidence for NFR-06, so the human's own commit is the cleanest provenance; add `testdata/golden/labels.yaml` to `scripts/guard-human-files.sh` once the first labels land |
